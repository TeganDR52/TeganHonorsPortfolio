<h2> Cool Things I'm Involved With! </h2>

<p>
Below is a list of all of the clubs and organizations I'm either a member of or volunteer for! They're all amazing groups of people, so I highly
reccomend that you check them out if you have any interest in them! 
</p>

<div class = "FunFact1">

<p>
I am currently a member of the UC CubeCats! They are a student-run organization that works on cube sattelites and weather balloons. I'm currently
a member of their CATiSE program, and I'm hoping to advance to their CubeSat program this spring!

<br>
<br>

For more information, I encourage you to check out their very own website linked <a href = "https://uccubecats.github.io/" target = "_blank">
here!</a> They're a very cool group, and have connections with NASA and other professionals in engineering! 
</p>

<br>

<div class = "FunFact2">

<img src = "Pictures/SelfDefenseLogo.jpg" alt = "University of Cincinnati Self Defense Club Logo" class = "FactPic2">

<p>
I am also currently a member of the UC Self-Defense Club! They host self-defense classes on campus led by trained professionals. I joined
because I'm short and look like an easy target, so it would be useful for me to know how to defend myself if I run into anyone dangerous out 
on the streets of Cincinnati. 

<br>
<br>

For more information, I encourage you to check out their page on GetInvolvedUC linked 
<a href = "https://campuslink.uc.edu/organization/ucsd" target = "_blank">here!</a> They're open to everyone and have 3 classes listed on their 
page you can attend!
</p>

</div>

<br>

<div class = "FunFact1">

<p>
I am currently volunteering every Friday at the Cincinnati Hillel to help clean up after their Shabbat Evening Experiences! They are a center for 
young Jewish life in Cincinnati and are very friendly. They also make very good food! 

<br>
<br>

For more information, I encourage you to check out their website linked <a href = "https://www.cincinnatihillel.org/" target = "_blank">here!</a>
They're very welcoming of newcomers and, if there's spots available, likely wouldn't mind a helping hand!
