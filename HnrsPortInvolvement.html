<h2> Cool Things I'm Involved With! </h2>

<p>
Below is a list of all of the clubs and organizations I'm either a member of or volunteer for, as well as some things I'm involved with 
outside of campus life! They're all amazing groups of people, so I highly reccomend that you check them out if you have any interest in them!

<p>
I am currently an active member of the Butterflies and Moths of North America (BAMONA) project! BAMONA is a project for 
collecting information about Lepidoptera through citizen science. You can submit any pictures of butterflies
and moths to the website as long as you include where and when they're taken, and they'll help you to identify the species (or 
confirm your own identification if you identified it yourself), in exchange for providing them information!

<br>
<br>

For more information, I encourage you to check out their website linked 
<a href = "https://www.butterfliesandmoths.org/" target = "_blank">here!</a>

<p>
I am currently volunteering every Friday at the Cincinnati Hillel to help clean up after their Shabbat Evening Experiences! They are a center for 
young Jewish life in Cincinnati and are very friendly. They also make very good food! 

<br>
<br>

For more information, I encourage you to check out their website linked <a href = "https://www.cincinnatihillel.org/" target = "_blank">here!</a>
They're very welcoming of newcomers and, if there's spots available, likely wouldn't mind a helping hand!

<p>
I am also volunteering for the Homework Club, hosted at the Washington United Church of Christ! It is a secular club centered around
providing tutoring and after school help to low-income elementary school-aged children. I've worked with children at my church in 
the past, so this is a great way for me to further grow my skills in helping children.
