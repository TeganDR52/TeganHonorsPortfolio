<h2> All The Fun Stuff! </h2>

<p> 
This is a webpage devoted to all of my fun and mostly inconsequential side projects. Some are art-related, some are crafts, and all
of them are were included to help make this website as enjoyable to visit as possible. So I hope you enjoy!

<div class = "CollapsibleContent">

<p> 
If you couldn't already tell, I am a massive fan of bugs. Big or small, delicate or dangerous - I think they're unique and beautiful,
and every time I'm outside in nature, they're the first thing to catch my eye. I also happen to possess some decently-trained art
skill. So, I put two and two together, and started a series of bug artwork online for everyone to enjoy! Some are bugs local to the
area, while others are species I found while fluttering through the web. One day I hope that more people find this artwork, and that
they begin to see the beauty I see in them, and appreciate them more as a vital part of our world's ecosystems. 
</p>

<p> 
I have 50 days of daily bug art planned, so be sure to check back if you like what you see!

<div class = "CollapsibleContent2">

<p>
By the same creators of Pokemon Go, there is a game that I believe is even better called Pikmin Bloom. You walk around, and the game
tracks your steps. Along the way, you can collect seedlings to grow into silly little Pikmin to follow you around, and eventually
collect enough petals from them to plant flowers as you walk!
<p>

<p>
It's a very wholesome little game, and it is a very fun way to track the amount of steps you walk around campus from day to day, all
the while feeling rewarded as you collect new Pikmin and plant pretty flowers on the map of our campus! I highly reccomend giving the 
game a try. You can download it on the App Store or Google Play for your mobile device and create an account to get started!
</p>

<p>
You also won't be starting this journey alone, as I'm placing my friend code here for you to friend me! So, if you're starting playing
it for the first time, feel free to friend me! And if you already regularly enjoy playing this game, you can still add a new friend
to your friend list!
