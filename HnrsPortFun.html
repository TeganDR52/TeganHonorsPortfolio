<h2> All The Fun Stuff! </h2>

<p> 
This is a webpage devoted to all of my fun and mostly inconsequential side projects. Some are art-related, some are crafts, and all
of them are sheerly made for the joy and passion I have for creating odd and whimsical things. I hope you enjoy!

<h2> Daily Bug Art </h2>

<p> 
If you couldn't already tell, I am a massive fan of bugs. Big or small, delicate or dangerous - I think they're unique and beautiful,
and every time I'm outside in nature, they're the first thing to catch my eye. I also happen to possess some decently-trained art
skill. So, I put two and two together, and started a series of bug artwork online for everyone to enjoy! Some are bugs local to the
area, while others are species I found while fluttering through the web. One day I hope that more people find this artwork, and that
they begin to see the beauty I see in them, and appreciate them more as a vital part of our world's ecosystems. 
</p>

<p> 
I have 50 days of daily bug art planned, so be sure to check back if you like what you see!
