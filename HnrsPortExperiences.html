<h2> My UHP Experiences </h2>

<p>
Over the course of my time in the honors program, students are expected to innovate and push past barriers, work towards inclusivity,
and make a positive impact through a variety of experiences. Five are expected but more can be completed if one wishes.
</p>

<p>
Below are my own experiences, whether self-designed, pre-approved, or otherwise. Each one expanded upon my current knowledge and 
helped me grow not just as a global citizen scholar, but also a person, in many ways. 
</p>

<p>
And no - none of these experiences involve flamingos. I just thought the picture looked nice and shouldn't go to waste. 
</p>

<div class = "FunFact1">

<p>
There is no blurb for this honors experience. And that link is broken. This experience hasn't been experienced yet. But it will be
soon so stay tuned!
