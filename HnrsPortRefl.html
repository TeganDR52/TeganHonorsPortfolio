<h2> My Years In Review </h2>

<p>
Each year, it is imperative that each of us as members of the esteemed University Honors Program write a review, reflecting on how
our year has went and what we have learned. And I, as a member of the University Honors Program, will do the same. Below 
are all of my completed reflective pieces on each academic term I've attended this fine university.

Global Citizen Scholar. A word I once used to look forward to hearing every Monday morning. A word I grew to loathe for every bit of false 
positivity it appeared to represent. And a word I would soon grow into and love as I'm made to appreciate the title more and more all over the 
course of a year.

This is where my second Year-In-Review reflective piece will be linked. Unfortunately, I'm only a first-year student as of currently.
Thanks for opening this anyway, though!

What is this? A year listed after I said 2028 would be my graduating year?? All a result of changing majors, and although this year won't
be covered under scholarship, it will be worth it to become a teacher in the end. This will be my final year-in-review now, and I am
nowhere near the point of even thinking about writing it. But thanks for opening it and checking it out anyway!
