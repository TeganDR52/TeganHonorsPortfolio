<h2> My Story </h2>

<p>
My story is pretty straightforward.
</p>

<p>
I grew up in the suburbs playing my Pokemon games and those cheap game systems made for children. I played pretend Pokemon with the boys at 
recess and desperately tried to get other girls interested in my favorite games. I learned how to code in middle school from a coding 
website called Scratch. I was surrounded by technology, whether it be through my parent’s clunky laptop, my trusty Nintendo DS, 
the Chromebooks I was lent by my school for assignments each day, or the gizmos and gadgets lying around in my dad's basement. And 
I learned over the years how to get the technology I was surrounded by to bend to my will.
</p>

<p>
I was a computer kid. I still am a computer kid. I’ll always be a computer kid. 
</p>

<p>
Straightforward as that.
</p>

<p>
I wish. 
</p>

<p>
My school wasn’t able to provide a strong technological education at the time I attended; the computer labs filled with the now
archaic desktop machines running Windows 8. You were lucky if you could get one to even just boot up and load Google Docs for an hour. 
And yet I came into the labs every day, patiently troubleshooting every issue I ran into. I learned over time how to get even some of 
the most finicky devices to work, even fixing a computer my class needed for a project one day when all hope was thought to be lost.
</p>

<p>
And yet even in my triumph of being able to get any computer to work, I still faced the hardship of the judgment by my peers. 
The girls thought I was strange. The boys thought I was annoying. And when it came down to it and fixed something when it truly counted,
my teacher told me to "leave the computers to the boys."
</p>

<p>
But I kept pushing forwards. I took an AP level computer science class my freshman year. I went to a vocational school to learn 
about information technology through my junior and senior years. And now I’m here – a student in the University Honors Program 
pursuing a degree in information technology, specifically studying software development and game design. For every bump in the road and 
person that has tried to tear me down, I've only grown and improved. I am an enterprising individual, always looking to expand my 
knowledge or take on a new challenge - and nobody is going to stand in my way. 
</p>

<h2> Other Facts About Me </h2>

<div class = "FunFact1">

<img src = "Pictures/TigerMothPic.jpeg" alt = "Picture of my favorite species of moth, Apantesis phalerata, on a plant in my front yard" class = "FactPic1">

<p>
I am a huge fan of bugs, especially butterflies and moths, and I'm always looking for opportunities to let them crawl up onto my hands for a 
cool picture!

<br>
<br>

The one shown in this picture is my favorite species of moth, Apantesis phalerata, more commonly known as the Harnessed Tiger Moth. Did you
know that this moth is capable of emitting high-frequency clicks to keep away bats? It has tymbals on its metathorax similar to cicadas that 
it can use to make a sound frequent enough to jam their echolocation and communicate to others of their species.

I am an artist, drawing both on paper with colored pencils, and electronically with my tablet and a cheap pen from Amazon. I also occasionally
dabble in clay, and sometimes even go back to my roots of drawing with crayon. A lot of my best work is posted on my page of fun stuff, so
be sure to check that out if you're interested!

<p>
One of my current side quests has been learning how to garden and raise plants. I love the idea of helping to take care of something 
living even if I can't currently own a pet due to me living in a dorm, and I like the idea of having something in my dorm to 
provide me with fresh oxygen! I currently have four plants: two succulents, one unidentified plant, and one pot of seeds that 
have yet to sprout.
