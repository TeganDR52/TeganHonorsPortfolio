<p>
My story was pretty straightforward.
</p>

<p>
I grew up in the suburbs playing my Pokemon games and those cheap game systems made for children. I played pretend Pokemon with the boys at 
recess and desperately tried to get other girls interested in my favorite games. I learned how to code in middle school from a coding 
website called Scratch. I was surrounded by technology, whether it be through my parent’s clunky laptop, my trusty Nintendo DS, 
the Chromebooks I was lent by my school for assignments each day, or the gizmos and gadgets lying around in my dad's basement. And 
I learned over the years how to get the technology I was surrounded by to bend to my will.
</p>

<p>
I was a computer kid. I still am a computer kid. I’ll always be a computer kid. 
</p>

<p>
Or so I thought.
</p>

<p>
In all those nights dreaming of what I could be; the code I'd write, the places I'd see, in all of them and more – I wanted to 
know code well enough to eventually settle down and teach it to a class of eager peers. Just like my programming teacher through 
high school. But forced against my will, writing programs I had no love for, applying for jobs that meant nothing to me, being 
disregarded by my peers, teachers, advisors – I couldn't take it anymore. 
</p>

<p>
People believe that the strong will fight on. Continue pursuing this path to see the brighter future on the other side. 
Continue against their will. Against your will. 
</p>

<p>
But sometimes the strongest thing you could do, the strongest action of all, is admitting to yourself that this path, 
this path you've spent years preparing to trek, that you've spent your whole life fighting through – isn't the one for you. 
</p>

<p>
The strongest thing to do, in a world full of people that will motivate you to continue "keeping up the good work," or "keep doing 
what you do best," – or even pressure you, believing "this is the only way" – is to follow your true passion. To go against their will 
and do what you love, even if they believe it isn't right. To go against your will, the falsified dreams you convinced yourself to 
believe and work towards for years, and do what you feel the most love for doing. 
</p>

<p>
And for me that's teaching. 
</p>

<p>
Believe me – I know this field is going to be a rough one. The pay is horrendous. Their funding could get cut. 
The youth of today will only become more cold, jaded, stubborn, or troublesome to make it in these egregiously more jaded and 
horrific times we're approaching. 
</p>

<p>
But I don't care.
</p>

<p>
I'd rather spend my entire life with nothing but the work I've done for them and the work I love and feel most passionate about 
doing, than to waste it all on everything and a role that doesn't give me any form of fulfillment. I want to be an elementary school 
teacher. I want to make learning exciting and enjoyable again. But most importantly – I just want to see my students smile, and 
leave these formative years of their childhood lives with happy memories.

<p>
I am a huge fan of bugs, especially lepidoptera, and I'm always looking for opportunities to let them crawl 
up onto my hands for a cool picture!

<br>
<br>

The one shown in this picture is my favorite species of moth, Apantesis phalerata, more commonly known as the Harnessed Tiger Moth. Did you
know that this moth is capable of emitting high-frequency clicks to keep away bats? It has tymbals on its metathorax similar to cicadas that 
it can use to make a sound frequent enough to jam their echolocation and communicate to others of their species.

I am an artist, drawing both on paper with colored pencils, and electronically with my tablet and a cheap pen from Amazon. I also occasionally
dabble in clay, and sometimes even go back to my roots of drawing with crayon. A lot of my best work is posted on my page of fun stuff, so
be sure to check that out if you're interested!

<br>
<br>

I lied, it's not. This whole website is a giant WIP. Don't go there looking for it!

One of my current side quests has been learning how to garden and raise plants. I love the idea of helping to take care of something 
living even if I can't currently own a pet due to me living in a dorm, and I like the idea of having something in my dorm to 
provide me with fresh oxygen!
